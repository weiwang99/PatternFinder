Options:
	-help                   Displays this help page 
	/?                      Displays this help page    
	-f [string]             Sets file name to be processed  
	-min [unsigned long]    Sets the minimum pattern length to be searched
	-max [unsigned long]    Sets the maximum pattern length to be searched
	-d                      Outputs pattern count per level
	-c                      Finds the best threading scheme for computer 
	-threads [unsigned int] Sets thread count to be used                 
	-mem [unsigned long]    Sets the maximum RAM memory that can be used in MB
	-lev [unsigned long]    Sets the first level to start output  
	-his [unsigned long]    Sets the first level to write history to disk
	-ram                    Forces program to use only RAM 
	-hd                     Forces program to use Hard Disk based on -mem
	-start [unsigned long]  Level to begin searching (not used currently)
	-p [string]             String to search for in file
	-o [unsigned long]      Mimimum occurrences to consider a pattern (Default occurences will be 2)
	-s                      Only searches for patterns that occur once ie outliers patterns of a file
	-cov 					Coverage means how much of the calculated patterns covered the entirety of the file
	
Examples:
	The example below processes a file for patterns of size 1 to
	100.  Logs information with -v 1.  The program will use 9 threads
	for processing and is forced to operate only using RAM.		

	-f TPB.avi -v 1 -min 1 -max 100 -threads 9 -ram
